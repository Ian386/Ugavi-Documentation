# 🌍 Supply2U - Geographical Information System for Food Supply Chains

## 📌 Overview
Supply2U is an innovative Geographic Information System (GIS) project that enhances agricultural supply chains by integrating geolocation data, real-time analytics, and consumer behavior insights. Our platform empowers farmers and all stakeholders involved—from farm to fork—by optimizing logistics, ensuring traceability, and improving efficiency in food distribution.

### 🚀 Our Mission
Agricultural supply chains in East Africa face inefficiencies that lead to post-harvest losses, inflated costs, and reduced farmer profits. Consumers and retailers also struggle with food traceability and supply chain transparency. Supply2U aims to address these challenges through:
- **Real-Time Monitoring & Logistics Optimization** 🚛📍
- **Traceability & Transparency** 🔍🌾
- **Supply Chain Optimization** 🏭📦
- **Data-Driven Decision Making** 📊📈

By leveraging geolocation technology, we connect farmers, agro-dealers, retailers, and logistics providers, ensuring a more efficient, sustainable, and profitable food supply chain.
